## Versioning

The version is broken down into 4 points e.g 1.2.3.4 We use MAJOR.MINOR.FEATURE.PATCH to describe the version numbers.

A MAJOR is very rare, it would only be considered if the source was effectively re-written or a clean break was desired for other reasons. This increment would likely break most 3rd party modules.

A MINOR is when there are significant changes that affect core structures. This increment would likely break some 3rd party modules.

A FEATURE version is when new extensions or features are added (such as a payment gateway, shipping module etc). Updating a feature version is at a low risk of breaking 3rd party modules.

A PATCH version is when a fix is added, it should be considered safe to update patch versions e.g 1.2.3.4 to 1.2.3.5

Developer release source code will not change once tagged.
